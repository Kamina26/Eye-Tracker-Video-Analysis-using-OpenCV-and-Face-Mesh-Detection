# Eye-Tracker-Video-and-pictures-Analysis-using-OpenCV-and-Face-Mesh-Detection
This repository contains a Python script for eye tracking using OpenCV and the cvzone Face Mesh Detection module. The script processes video files to detect the position of a person's left eye and tracks the iris movements to classify gaze direction as "left," "right," or "center." It also supports saving the processed video output.
